### [Insertion Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort) : `lib/insertionsort.rb`

Insertion sort has a best case run time of `O(n)` and a worst-case runtime of `O(n^2)`. Specifically, the worst case is when the given set is in descending order. Memory efficiency is `O(1)`--the array is altered in place, and no extra variables are assigned (except for loop counters).
